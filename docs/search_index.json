The application defines default values for Database Credentials. These are stored in credentials.R and used by the glosis-shiny application: database_name &lt;- &quot;postgres&quot; host_name &lt;- &quot;postgis&quot; port_number &lt;- &quot;5432&quot; user_name &lt;- &quot;postgres&quot; password_name &lt;- &quot;glosis&quot; 3.3 Database Schema The GloSIS database schema follows ISO 28258 Data model. The model organizes soil-related data into six main categories, known as “features of interest,” each with specific subcategories: Site – Represents the broader environment where soil investigations occur, capturing terrain or land-use characteristics. Plot – A specific location for soil investigation, where soil profiles and samples are collected. It is further classified into: Surface – A polygonal area where soil properties are assumed homogeneous. TrialPit – A manually excavated pit for detailed soil examination. Borehole – A drilled hole for subsurface soil sampling. Profile – A vertical sequence of soil horizons or layers at a given location, fundamental for soil classification. Profile Element – Subdivisions of a profile based on depth, further categorized as: Horizon – A natural, homogeneous soil layer. Layer – An arbitrarily defined soil section, often for analysis. Soil Specimen – A physical sample extracted at a defined depth, typically analyzed in laboratories for chemical and physical properties.
