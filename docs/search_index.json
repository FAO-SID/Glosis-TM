[["visualization.html", "5 Visualization 5.1 View Data on the Dashboard 5.2 View data on the Data Viewer App", " 5 Visualization Two visualization tools are included in this app: a Dashboard viewer and a Data Viewer application in Shiny. Both are designed to display data from the GloSIS database in a user-friendly format, and the Data Viewer also allows the export of soil data points to .csv, .xlsx, and the clipboard. 5.1 View Data on the Dashboard The first visualization tool is a dashboard generated in .html format. This dashboard is useful for verifying whether the data has been correctly updated in the database, identifying potential errors in positioning, and detecting data outliers. The file contains all selected data from the GloSIS database, which may result in a large file size depending on the number of records. A Create Dashboard button appears after populating the GloSIS database with soil data (Figure 5.1). Figure 5.1: Create Dashboard button on the left panel of the data injection app. Clicking this button generates a .html file stored in theinit-scriptsfolder within the working directory, using the same name as the database. The application then renders the file, and a new button,Go to Dashboard, will appear (Figure 5.2). Figure 5.2: Go to Dashboard button in green color. Clicking this button opens a new tab displaying soil data, in .htmlformat, in three sections (Figure 5.3): Location – Details about the position of the soil data points. Attributes – Data on soil properties. Boxplot – Histograms showing the distribution of soil properties across profiles and depths for quick visual comparisons. Figure 5.3: Visualization of the soil data in the dashboard.. Tables and the map are internally linked, allowing users to select specific soils either on the map or in the tables, with their location and attributes automatically filtered. The Make a selection button on the map can be used for this task when selecting directly from the map (Figure 5.4). Figure 5.4: Boxplot visualization of filtered soil data attributes. 5.2 View data on the Data Viewer App The second visualization tool is accessible via the Go to Data Viewer button (Figure 5.5) at the bottom of the glosis-shiny app. Clicking this button opens a new tab (Figure 5.5) with a dropdown menu listing available databases. These databases are those previously created within the glosis-shiny app. The button Go to GloSIS database brings you back to the glosis-shiny app for data injection. Figure 5.5: Visualization app. After selecting a database, clicking Connect displays the soil data both in a tabular format and as a map showing the locations of soil samples (Figure 5.6). Figure 5.6: Visualization app showing soil data from the selected database. Similar to the dashboard, this tool is designed primarily for data verification and correction. Data can be exported to other file formats. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
