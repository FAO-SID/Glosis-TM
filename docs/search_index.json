Open the glosis-shiny application in your web browser at http://localhost:3838/iso28258/. This site will display the main window of the application. The window contains a dropdown menu listing all existing databases in the system (empty if running for the first time), a button to connect to the selected database, a button to create a new database, and a Remove button to delete an existing database. The first step is to create a new database to store the soil data. The New Database button is intended for this task (Figure 5.1). When clicked, a dialog window will pop up asking for the database name. Enter a name in the field and click the Confirm button. A message will appear indicating that the database has been successfully created. In case the database already exists, the message will also indicates it. The new database will be stored in the data folder within the working directory and will become active in the Select Database dropdown menu. The first step is to create a new database to store the soil data using the New Database button (Figure (ref?)(fig:newdb)). A dialog window will pop up asking for the database name. Enter a name in the field and click the Confirm button. A message will appear indicating that the database has been successfully created. If the database already exists, the message will indicate this as well. The new database will be stored in the data folder within the working directory and will become available in the Select Database dropdown menu. Figure 5.1: Creation of a new database. 5.2 Upload data to inject. At this point, the main body of the application will show the column names for each table but the registers are still empty. It the database has previous data, the tables will show the already inserted data. The data of the .xlsx will be transferred to the new created database. Select the database to be filled in the Select Database dropdown menu and click on the Connect buttom. A new section ÃŒNJECT DATA (.xlsx) will appear in the sidebar. This includes a Browse button to select the .xlsx data to insert into de database. To inject new data, click on the After uploading the .xlsx file a message will appear indicating that the data is being processed for its inclusion in the database (Figure 5.2). The database will show the results for each table when finished. Figure 5.2: Information in the Specimen Data sheet. 5.3 Delete an existing database. {#processing-database. .#illustration} The Specimen Data sheet (Figure 5.3) contains detailed soil information at the sample level, including data from each individual horizon or layer, their boundaries, and associated soil properties derived from laboratory analyses. For each sampled horizon or layer, the sheet includes unique identifiers for the profile, element, and specimen (profile_code,element_code,specimen_code). These identifiers should follow a structured naming convention, typically consisting of the soil profile name followed by a numeric sequence corresponding to the sampled horizon or layer. However, they can be freely named as long as they remain unique. The sheet also specifies the type of observation (Layeror Horizon), as well as the upper and lower depth boundaries (upper_depth, lower_depth). A Horizon refers to a genetically classified horizon in the soil profile, while a Layer represents a soil sample collected based on alternative criteria, such as a fixed depth interval rather than pedogenetic origin. Additionally, the sheet records the corresponding physical and chemical values of soil properties obtained from laboratory analyses, including pH, Soil Organic Carbon, clay content, and other relevant properties.
