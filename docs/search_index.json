[["index.html", "Technical Manual for Data Injection into the GloSIS Database 1 Introduction 1.1 System Requirements", " Technical Manual for Data Injection into the GloSIS Database Luis Rodríguez Lado, Eloi Ribeiro, Marcos Angelini 2025-03-17 1 Introduction The Global Soil Information System (GloSIS) is a key initiative under the Global Soil Partnership (GSP), designed to integrate and standardize soil data globally. However, soil information is often scattered across paper reports, scientific articles, and national archives, making it difficult to access, compare, and utilize effectively. Additionally, variability in laboratory analytical procedures, sampling methods, and classification systems leads to inconsistencies that hinder accurate global assessments. Harmonization is essential to standardize data formats, analytical methods, and reporting frameworks, ensuring comparability, accessibility, and reliability. To address these challenges, the GloSIS database is structured as a harmonized relational database in PostgreSQL, following ISO 28258 standards for soil data storage. However, its complexity can pose difficulties for users unfamiliar with SQL or PostgreSQL programming, making it challenging to convert existing soil data into this standardized format. This Technical Manual provides guidance on implementing a PostgreSQL database aligned with the GloSIS schema and introduces the glosis-shiny service—a tool designed to simplify the conversion of soil data into the GloSIS format. By automating and harmonizing data integration, this application streamlines the workflow, making the process accessible to users without advanced SQL expertise. This step is crucial for building the GloSIS infrastructure, ensuring that soil data from various sources can be shared, compared, and utilized effectively on a global scale. This document provides a detailed technical manual on setting up two Docker-based services: GloSIS PostgreSQL database (glosis-db). R Shiny application for soil data injection and visualization of soil data (glosis-shiny). It covers the installation and deployment of the applications using Docker, the process of data preparation for data injection workflow from Excel (xlsx) files and the visualization of the data. This document uses three soils profiles from undisturbed forests from the PhD dissertation Soils, water and nutrients in a forest ecosystem in Suriname (Poels 1987), available at https://edepot.wur.nl/202240, as an exercise for soil data harmonization. 1.1 System Requirements Docker Desktop installed R and RStudio installed (for local debugging) PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension References "],["installation-and-setup.html", "2 Installation and Setup 2.1 Install Docker Desktop 2.2 Install the GloSIS database services 2.3 Accessing the Services 2.4 The docker-compose.yml File", " 2 Installation and Setup The GloSIS database service is provided as a Docker container, which allows users to deploy and manage the system without manually installing software dependencies. This approach ensures stability, compatibility, and easy updates. Docker Compose is a tool used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows users to orchestrate multiple services using a single configuration file ( see Section The docker-compose.yml file). The key benefits of Docker Compose include: Simplified Deployment – Automatically pulls and runs multiple containers with a single command. Predefined Configuration – Ensures all services are correctly configured and work together. Portability – The same configuration can be used across different systems without installation issues. The system consists of two main services, both running as Docker containers: glosis-db – A GloSIS harmonized PostgreSQL database that stores soil data following the ISO 28258 standard. glosis-shiny – A Shiny web application providing a graphical interface to inject structured Excel files into the database. These services are built from pre-configured Docker images and automatically deployed as containers using Docker Compose, meaning all dependencies are pre-configured, ensuring a consistent and reproducible execution across different operating systems. This section provides step-by-step instructions to set up the GloSIS soil database, including the installation of Docker Desktop, PostgreSQL, and R. The setup process is containerized using Docker, 2.1 Install Docker Desktop Before proceeding, Docker Desktop must be installed in your computer. 2.1.1 Windows Enable Hyper-V Docker Desktop requires Hyper-V as well as the Hyper-V Module for Windows PowerShell to be installed and enabled. In most systems, the Docker Desktop installer enables it for you. To test if Hyper-V is enabled, go to the start menu and type: Turn Windows features on or off and press enter. In the subsequent screen, verify that Hyper-V is enabled. To install Hyper-V manually, see Install Hyper-V on Windows 10. A reboot is required after installation. If you install Hyper-V without rebooting, Docker Desktop does not work correctly. In some Windows systems Virtualization must be enabled in the BIOS. Note that many Windows devices already have virtualization enabled, so this may not apply. Download Docker Desktop for Windows from the official website. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. After installation, restart your computer. Open Docker Desktop and ensure it is running. 2.1.2 MacOS Download Docker Desktop for Mac from the official website. Open the .dmg file and drag Docker into the Applications folder. Start Docker Desktop and allow any requested system permissions. 2.1.3 Linux Open a terminal and run the following commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install docker.io -y sudo systemctl start docker sudo systemctl enable docker Add your user to the Docker group (to run Docker without sudo): sudo usermod -aG docker $USER Restart your computer and verify Docker is running: docker --version If the installation was successful, you should see output similar to: Docker version 24.0.5, build 123456 2.2 Install the GloSIS database services The easiest way to install the GloSIS database services is by pulling pre-built Docker images available in the GloSIS docker hub. 2.2.1 Steps Ensure Docker Desktop is running. Download the GloSIS repository from GitHub: Go to: `https://github.com/FAO-SID/Glosis-App`. Click the green \"Code\" button, then select Download ZIP (Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Clonning the repository. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g. in the Desktop folder). Open a Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the extracted folder: cd Desktop/Glosis-App Start the GloSIS services by running: docker-compose up -d The first time you run this command, it may take a few minutes to download all required images. 2.2.2 Verify Installation Using Docker Desktop Open Docker Desktop and check if the containers are running (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: Docker desktop. If everything is working, the project and service icons should be green. If any service fails, the icon will appear orange (Figure 2.3). Figure 2.3: Failure on some docker desktop service. Using the Terminal To manually check if the services are running, type: docker ps You should see an output similar to: CONTAINER ID IMAGE STATUS PORTS 973bf939 luislado/glosis-shiny:latest Up 2 minutes 0.0.0.0:3838-&gt;3838/tcp 4fd00c73 luislado/glosis-postgis:latest Up 2 minutes 0.0.0.0:5442-&gt;5432/tcp To stop the services at any time, use: docker-compose down This will stop and remove the containers, but your database data will remain intact in the data/postgis directory. 2.3 Accessing the Services Shiny Web Application: To open the GloSIS Shiny App, enter this address in your web browser: http://localhost:3838/ This will load the interface where you can upload and inject soil data from .xlsx files (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: GloSIS shiny application. GloSIS database: The PostgreSQL GloSIS database is available to connect with other applications such as pgAdmin, DBeaver,QGIS, R, etc, at: localhost:5442 The user and password for the connection is ‘glosis’ by default. 2.4 The docker-compose.yml File The docker-compose.yml file defines how the GloSIS database service and Shiny web application interact within a Docker environment. This configuration file ensures that both components are deployed together with the correct settings, storage locations, and networking. This file creates two containers: glosis-db: A PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extensions for handling spatial data. This database stores all soil data in accordance with the ISO 28258 standard. glosis-shiny: A Shiny web application that provides a graphical interface for users to inject structured Excel files into the database. To ensure persistent data storage, the database files are stored outside the containers in the data/postgis directory. This means that even if the containers are stopped or removed, the database remains intact. 2.4.1 Networking and Port Configuration A dedicated Docker network (glosis-net) is created to allow seamless internal communication between the database and the Shiny application. This ensures the services can interact without interference from other network traffic on the host system. For PostgreSQL, port 5442 is used instead of the default 5432. This prevents potential conflicts with any existing PostgreSQL installation on the host machine. When the container is launched, PostgreSQL inside the container still listens on 5432, but it is mapped externally to 5442 to avoid interference with other PostgreSQL instances that may already be running. The Shiny application is made accessible through port 3838, which remains unchanged from the standard port used by Shiny. 2.4.2 Structure of the docker-compose.yml file The following docker-compose.yml configuration defines these services: services: postgis: image: luislado/glosis-postgis:latest # Pre-configured PostgreSQL database with PostGIS container_name: glosis-db restart: always environment: DB_HOST: postgis DB_PORT: 5432 DB_NAME: postgres DB_USER: postgres DB_PASSWORD: glosis POSTGRES_PASSWORD: glosis ports: - &quot;5442:5432&quot; # Maps internal PostgreSQL port 5432 to external port 5442 to avoid conflicts volumes: - ./data/postgis:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Stores database files persistently - ./init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d # Includes schema initialization scripts networks: - glosis-net shinyapp: image: luislado/glosis-shiny:latest # Shiny app for data injection container_name: glosis-shiny restart: always environment: DB_HOST: postgis DB_PORT: 5442 # Uses the externally mapped port to connect to PostgreSQL DB_NAME: postgres DB_USER: postgres DB_PASSWORD: glosis ports: - &quot;3838:3838&quot; # Exposes the Shiny application on port 3838 volumes: - ./init-scripts:/srv/shiny-server/init-scripts # Stores scripts and outputs depends_on: - postgis # Ensures the database is running before starting the Shiny app networks: - glosis-net networks: glosis-net: driver: bridge This configuration ensures that: The database container (glosis-db) starts first and runs independently. The Shiny application (glosis-shiny) waits for the database before launching. Data is stored outside the containers to prevent loss in case the containers are restarted or deleted. Port conflicts are avoided by mapping PostgreSQL’s internal port 5432 to 5442 on the host machine. With this setup, users can easily run and manage the GloSIS database service and its Shiny web interface while ensuring stability and avoiding conflicts with other PostgreSQL installations. "],["glosis-database.html", "3 GloSIS Database 3.1 GloSIS Database Configuration 3.2 Database Credentials 3.3 Database Schema", " 3 GloSIS Database This section provides details on the GloSIS database in PostgreSQL. 3.1 GloSIS Database Configuration 3.2 Database Credentials The connection to PostgreSQL requires the specification of the . The application defines default values for Database Credentials. These are stored in credentials.R and used by the glosis-shiny application: database_name &lt;- &quot;postgres&quot; host_name &lt;- &quot;postgis&quot; port_number &lt;- &quot;5432&quot; user_name &lt;- &quot;postgres&quot; password_name &lt;- &quot;glosis&quot; 3.3 Database Schema The database schema follows ISO 28258 (GloSIS) standards. The main tables include: "],["data-preparation.html", "4 Data preparation 4.1 Understanding the XLSX Template 4.2 Plot Data Sheet 4.3 Specimen Data Sheet 4.4 Procedures Sheet 4.5 Codelist Sheet 4.6 Original Data Sheet", " 4 Data preparation The GloSIS database is structured as a complex relational PostgreSQL database. Its intricate design can pose challenges for users who are not familiar with SQL or PostgreSQL programming, making it difficult to directly translate soil data into this format. The primary objective of the glosis-shiny application is to facilitate the conversion of soil data from an easy to read and compile format, into a standardized PostgreSQL database format for integration with the GloSIS platform. By automating and harmonizing the data injection into the PostgreSQL database, the application significantly streamlines the workflow, making it more accessible for users without advanced technical expertise. This step is crucial in building the GloSIS infrastructure, as it ensures that soil data from different sources can be shared and compared effectively. The data injection is performed thought a standardized Excel (.xlsx) template that serves as an intermediary format for structuring soil data before its integration into the PostgreSQL database. This template ensures that the data follows a predefined schema, aligning with the complex relational structure of the GloSIS database. The template consists of multiple sheets, each corresponding to a specific data entity, such as site information, soil horizons/layers, laboratory procedures, and analytical results structured in different sheets. Each column in these sheets is carefully labeled to match the expected database fields, reducing errors and ensuring data consistency. Users are required to fill in the template while adhering to specific data formats, such as numeric values for measurements, categorical values for predefined classifications, and geospatial coordinates in standard longitude and latitude formats. The structured nature of the template minimizes manual intervention and ensures that data is correctly mapped when it is processed by the glosis-shiny application. The application validates the input, identifies potential discrepancies, and harmonizes the dataset before transferring it into PostgreSQL, ultimately simplifying the data submission process while maintaining accuracy and comparability. The data in the standardized Excel template must be collected in a harmonized manner to ensure consistency and accuracy during integration into the GloSIS database. This requires harmonization of spatial coordinates to the EPSG:4326 coordinate system recorded in the Plot_Data sheet, ensuring homogeneous sample georeferencing. Additionally, the identification of standard soil property names, laboratory methods, and units of measurement must be correctly defined in the Procedures sheet. If the original data is recorded in different units, it must be converted to match the standardized units specified in the Procedures sheet before inclusion in the Specimen_Data sheet. Furthermore, all soil properties listed in the Specimen Data and Procedures sheets must correspond to those available in the Codelist sheet, which contains the standardized soil properties defined in the GloSIS codelist. Any property not included in the Codelist sheet must be removed from the template before data injection to ensure compatibility with the GloSIS database. This harmonization process is essential for maintaining data consistency, facilitating data sharing, and ensuring seamless integration with the global soil information system. 4.1 Understanding the XLSX Template The Excel file consists of multiple sheets that include the corresponding information to populate the different PostgreSQL GloSIS database tables: Plot Data: The Plot Data sheet contains essential information for describing the sampling locations and associated metadata. Specimen Data: This sheet contains soil information at the sample level, including laboratory analyses. Procedures: This sheet establishes the connection between measured soil properties, standardized soil property names, laboratory methods, and units of measurement, ensures consistency and interoperability between different soil datasets. Codelist: This sheet shows a compilation of all the standardized soil property names, laboratory methods, and units of measurement according to the GloSIS codelist for soil properties) Original Data: This sheet is optional but serves as a record of the original sampling values for soil descriptions and analytical properties.. The template acts as a graphical interface where you can register your soil data. In the following sections, we provide a detailed overview of each of these sheets. 4.2 Plot Data Sheet The Plot Data sheet (Figure 4.1) provides information about the sampling site. It included the identification of the project in which the sample was collected (project_code), the identifiers for the sampling site (site_code), plot (plot_code) and the profile (profile_code). The plot_type column describes whether the sample has been collected using an auger (Borehole) of comes from an open profile (Pit). The n_layers column indicates the number of samples collected at different depths for a given site. This information is essential for populating the Specimen_Data sheet when using the script provided in this manual (Annex 1). The number of samples corresponds to the number of horizons or layers collected at each sampling point. For example, if a soil profile consists of three horizons and all horizons have been sampled, the n_layers value will be 3. Date registers the date when the survey was conducted. The date format for this column must be “YYYY-MM-DD”. The next columns refer to the georeference of the sample including latitude, longitude, and altitude, along with details on positional accuracy (positional_accuracy), spatial extent (extent), and the corresponding map sheet reference (map_sheet_code). The spatial coordinates latitude and longitude must be in geographic decimal degrees using the EPSG:4326 coordinate system. Figure 4.1: Information in the Plot_Data Tab. 4.3 Specimen Data Sheet The Specimen Data sheet (Figure 4.2) contains detailed soil information at the sample level, including data from each individual horizon or layer, their boundaries, and associated soil properties derived from laboratory analyses. For each sampled horizon or layer, the sheet includes unique identifiers for the profile, element, and specimen (profile_code,element_code,specimen_code). These identifiers should follow a structured naming convention, typically consisting of the soil profile name followed by a numeric sequence corresponding to the sampled horizon or layer. However, they can be freely named as long as they remain unique. The sheet also specifies the type of observation (Layeror Horizon), as well as the upper and lower depth boundaries (upper_depth, lower_depth). A Horizon refers to a genetically classified horizon in the soil profile, while a Layer represents a soil sample collected based on alternative criteria, such as a fixed depth interval rather than pedogenetic origin. Additionally, the sheet records the corresponding physical and chemical values of soil properties obtained from laboratory analyses, including pH, Soil Organic Carbon, clay content, and other relevant properties. Figure 4.2: Information in the Specimen Data sheet. As an illustration, the columns with red values in Figure 4.2 indicate soil parameters that required unit conversions to align with GloSIS standard units of measurement, compared to their original values. 4.4 Procedures Sheet The Procedures sheet (Figure 4.3) establishes the connection between measured soil properties, standardized soil property names, laboratory methods, and units of measurement. It links the measured soil property names with their corresponding standardized identifiers (property_phys_chem_id) and incorporates information about the associated laboratory procedure identifier (procedure_phys_chem_id) and the standard unit of measurement (unit_of_measure_id) in the GloSIS standard Codelistsheet. The first column must contain the names of the measured soil properties for each sample, and must follow the sequence of soil properties included in the Specimen Data. The second, third, and fourth columns provide information on the standardized property names, laboratory methods, and units of measurement, respectively. The Procedures sheet facilitates accurate comparisons across datasets, allowing users to trace how each soil property was measured and in which units the results are reported. If soil measurements were recorded in units different from the standard, they must be converted to the harmonized units of measurement before entering the data in the Specimen Data sheet. This structured approach enhances data harmonization within the GloSIS framework. Figure 4.3: Information in the Procedures sheet. 4.5 Codelist Sheet The Codelist sheet (Figure 4.4) contains a comprehensive list of standardized soil property names (property_phys_chem_id), laboratory methods (procedure_phys_chem_id), and units of measurement (unit_of_measure_id), as defined in the current GloSIS codelist for soil properties. This standardized framework ensures uniformity in data representation and provides the foundation for accurately populating the Procedures sheet. Only soil properties listed in the Codelist sheet can be incorporated into the PostgreSQL GloSIS Database. Any measured soil property, method or unit that is not present in this standardized list cannot be uploaded and must be removed from both the Specimen Data and Procedures sheets before data injection. This requirement ensures the harmonization of soil datasets and maintains data interoperability within the GloSIS framework. However, the codelist is continuously updated to incorporate new soil analytical properties, laboratory methods, and measurement units, enhancing the system’s capacity for integrating diverse soil datasets. Figure 4.4: Properties, methods and units of measurement in the Codelist sheet 4.6 Original Data Sheet The Original Data sheet stores all raw data from soil analyses and descriptions. While optional, it is recommended for maintaining a record of original values, particularly when unit conversions or transformations are required. This sheet helps ensure data traceability and good documentation practices. Values in the Original Data sheet can be linked via formulas to the Specimen Data sheet, allowing for automated transformation and integration of adjusted values in this latter sheet while preserving the original records. Ensuring the correct utilization of the template is essential for the successful execution of the data injection process. Proper adherence to the template structure guarantees data integrity, compatibility, and seamless integration into the PostgreSQL GloSIS Database. "],["exercise-on-data-preparation.html", "5 Exercise on data preparation 5.1 Filling out the plot data sheet 5.2 Filling out the specimen data sheet 5.3 Filling out the procedures data sheet 5.4 Special Considerations:", " 5 Exercise on data preparation The example presented in this section uses data from three soil profiles from undisturbed forests in Suriname (Poels 1987) collected with a soil auger: one Orthic Ferralsol (Profile 35, 8 horizons) and two Xanthic Ferralsols (Profiles 36 and 37, 9 horizons each). This file is available in the test-data folder in your installation folder. It is also available at the GloSIS repository from GitHub. This data requires harmonization in coordinate systems, dates, soil properties, laboratory methods and units of measurement before being included in the GloSIS database. For simplification, only analytical data for selected soil parameters have been included in this exercise. 5.1 Filling out the plot data sheet As shown in Table 5.1, the harmonized plot data for this example include soil samples with standardized codes, coordinates and positional metadata. All soil profiles have been collected within the same project. The project_name column for all profiles is set to LH/UvS_01. The profile_code attribute follows the names of the soil profiles in the original document. The site_code and plot_code inform about the location of the sample. In this case site_code has been set to the district Para and site_code to the protected area of Kabo, where all samples were collected. Since the samples were collected with an auger, the plot_type attribute must be set to borehole The available options are borehole for auger sampling and pit if an open pit was excavated. For each soil sampling point, the n_layers attribute correspond to the number of horizons/layers collected at that point. In this case, n_layers is equal to the number of horizons sampled by profile. The date format in the original document follows the *DD Month YYYY* format (e.g., 27 May 1983). This format must be converted to *YYYY-MM-DD* (1983-05-27), which is the standard format accepted by the GloSIS database. The original coordinates of the points were expressed in degrees and minutes, using a central point as a reference (5°15’N, 55°43’W) and including displacement information in meters. Additionally, the coordinate system (EPSG) was not defined. We estimated the coordinates for each soil sampling point, using the information provided, in relation to the EPSG::4326 coordinate system (see Table 5.1). No corrections were necessary for altitude. The positional accuracy was estimated at 1850 m. The extent column refers to a surface plot. In this example, the samples are points, so no information on extent is applicable. The columns altitude, positional accuracy and map_sheet_code are optional. Table 5.1: Harmonized data for the plot data sheet for the exercise data. project_name site_code plot_code profile_code plot_type n_layers date longitude latitude altitude positional_accuracy extent map_sheet_code LH/UvS_01 Para Kabo Profile35 Borehole 8 1983-05-27 -55.7148 5.25 20 1850 LH/UvS_01 Para Kabo Profile36 Borehole 9 1978-08-10 -55.7166 5.25 27 1850 LH/UvS_01 Para Kabo Profile37 Borehole 9 1983-06-02 -55.7131 5.25 39 1850 5.2 Filling out the specimen data sheet The specimen data sheet contains information for each soil sample collected at each soil sampling location. The number of rows must therefore be equal to the total number of horizons/layers at each sampling location (n_layers). In this example, the total number of rows in this sheet is 26. Two different types of data are required in this sheet. First, the columns profile_code, element_code, type, order_element, upper_depth, lower_depth, and specimen_code serve as identifiers for samples, sample types, and soil depths (Table 5.2). The remaining columns correspond to soil properties measured through laboratory analyses. The profile_code column references the same attribute from the previous sheet and must contain repetitions corresponding to the number of horizons collected at each sampling location. The order_element column is a sequential number that increases from top to bottom horizons, starting from 1. The element_code is generated by combining the profile_code and order_element to create a unique identifier for each horizon. The type attribute is set to Horizon for genetic soil horizons. If the sample is not collected based on pedogenetic criteria but is defined by specific boundaries, the option Layer is used. The upper_depth and lower_depth columns specify the depth range (in cm) of each horizon or layer within the soil profile. Except for the top horizon, the upper_depth value of each horizon must match the lower_depth value of the preceding horizon within the same profile. The specimen_code is an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies each soil sample. In this case, the same value as element_code has been used for consistency.

Any value reported in different units MUST be converted to the harmonized units before being entered into this sheet.

Any analytical properties measured in units different from those specified in this sheet MUST be converted to the standard units before being entered into the specimen data sheet and uploaded to the glosis-shiny application. The first column in the Procedures sheet MUST contain all soil analytical properties included in the specimen data and in the same order of entrance. The proper GloSIS names for soil properties, analysis methods and units MUST be defined for each soil property using the data provided in the observation_phys_chem_id sheet. Properties that are not listed in the observation_phys_chem_id sheet are not allowed.

For these properties, transformation of laboratory measurements using the appropriate correction factors must be performed in the specimen data data sheet. However, for Bulk Density and Available Water Capacity (pF 2), although the units are written in a different format, they represent the same values. This sheet ensures that all soil properties are named according to the GloSIS standard and that the corresponding methods and units are correctly defined. 5.4 Special Considerations: Any soil property value that is missing MUST be left empty in the .xlsx template. Entries such as NA, nodata, -, etc., are not permitted. Ensure that all numeric values are correctly formatted as numbers in the template. Any alphanumeric entry in a numeric column will cause the entire column to be treated as alphanumeric. Special characters such as *, /, ?, etc., are not allowed. This includes the &lt; symbol, commonly used for values below the detection limit of analytical equipment. In such cases, either leave the value empty or replace it by dividing the detection limit by a factor of two. All soil properties that are not listed in the observation_phys_chem_id MUST be removed from the analysis. They cannot be included in either the specimen data or the Procedures sheets. If they are left in these sheets, the database will not be correctly populated. References "],["data-injection-into-the-glosis-database.html", "6 Data injection into the GloSIS database 6.1 Create a new database 6.2 Data injection 6.3 Delete an existing database", " 6 Data injection into the GloSIS database The translation of soil data into the GloSIS database has been fully automated within the glosis-shiny application. The steps to complete this process include creating a database to store the data and selecting a soil data .xlsx file that meets the requirements outlined in the previous section. Errors in this step are exclusively linked to improper data formatting in the .xlsx file. In such cases, please review the .xlsx file to identify any mistakes made during its preparation. When creating a new database, the system connects to the GloSIS GitHub repository to obtain the latest stable version of the database (ISO_28258_v_stable.sql) and uses it to generate an empty template for populating the data. During this process, the ISO_28258_v_stable.sql file is stored in the init-scripts folder within the working directory. Details on using the application for data injection are presented in the following sections of this chapter. 6.1 Create a new database Open the glosis-shiny application in your web browser at http://localhost:3838/iso28258/. This site will display the main window of the application. The window contains a SELECT DATABASE dropdown menu listing all existing databases in the system (empty if running for the first time), a Connect button to connect to the selected database, a New Database button to create a new database, and a Remove button to delete an existing database. The first step is to create a new database to store the soil data using the New Database button (Figure 6.1). Figure 6.1: Creation of a new database. A dialog window will pop up asking for the database name (Figure 6.2). Enter a name in the field and click the Confirm button. A message will appear asking for and administrative password. Leave this option empty and click Confirm. Figure 6.2: Name the database. A new message in green will appear in the sidebar, indicating that the database has been successfully created (Figure 6.3). If the database already exists, the message will indicate this as well. Figure 6.3: Name the database. The new database will be stored in the data folder within the working directory and will become available in the SELECT DATABASE dropdown menu. 6.2 Data injection Select the database to be filled from the SELECT DATABASE dropdown menu and click on the Connect button. At this point, the main body of the application will display the column names for each table, but the records will still be empty. If the database already contains data, the tables will show the previously inserted records. A new section, INJECT DATA (.xlsx), will appear in the sidebar. This section includes a Browse button to select the .xlsx file containing the data to be inserted into the database. Click this button to choose the .xlsx file, then click the Use button. The file will be uploaded and injected into the database. A message will appear indicating that the data is being processed for inclusion in the database (Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4: Message indicating data is being processed for injection into the database. Once the process is complete, the database will display the data for each table (Figure 6.5). Figure 6.5: GloSIS database populated showing the records for the table of physic and chemical analytical results. The database can be now accessed from other applications and updated with new record using the same glosis-shiny application. 6.3 Delete an existing database Databases can also be deleted using this application. However, database deletion should be performed with caution and requires security confirmation, such as a password. For educational purposes, the password is left blank by default, but it can be changed for development purposes. The Delete button is only available when disconnected from databases. To delete a database, select the database to remove from the SELECT DATABASE menu and click the Delete button. After confirmation (Figure 6.6), the database will be permanently removed. Figure 6.6: Deletion of a database. "],["visualization.html", "7 Visualization 7.1 View Data on the Dashboard 7.2 View data on the Data Viewer App 7.3 View data on the QGIS", " 7 Visualization Two visualization tools are included in this app: a Dashboard viewer and a Data Viewer application in Shiny. Both are designed to display data from the GloSIS database in a user-friendly format, and the Data Viewer also allows the export of soil data points to .csv, .xlsx, and the clipboard. 7.1 View Data on the Dashboard The first visualization tool is a dashboard generated in .html format. This dashboard is useful for verifying whether the data has been correctly updated in the database, identifying potential errors in positioning, and detecting data outliers. The file contains all selected data from the GloSIS database, which may result in a large file size depending on the number of records. A Create Dashboard button appears after populating the GloSIS database with soil data (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Create Dashboard button on the left panel of the data injection app. Clicking this button generates a .html file stored in the init-scripts folder within the working directory, using the same name as the database. The application then renders the file, and a new button,Go to Dashboard, will appear (Figure 7.2). Figure 7.2: Go to Dashboard button in green color. Clicking this button opens a .htmlformat file in a new tab displaying soil data in three sections (Figure 7.3): Location – Contains details about the position of the soil data points. Attributes – Data on soil properties. Boxplot – Data with value bars showing the distribution of soil properties across profiles and depths for quick visual comparisons. Figure 7.3: Visualization of the soil data in the dashboard.. Tables and the map are internally linked, allowing users to select specific soils either on the map or in the tables, with their location and attributes automatically filtered. The Make a selection button on the map can be used for this task when selecting directly from the map (Figure 7.4). Figure 7.4: Boxplot visualization of filtered soil data attributes. 7.2 View data on the Data Viewer App The second visualization tool is accessible via the Go to Data Viewer button (Figure 7.5) at the bottom of the glosis-shiny app. Clicking this button opens a new tab (Figure 7.5) with a dropdown menu listing available databases. These databases are those previously created within the glosis-shiny app. The button Go to GloSIS database brings you back to the glosis-shiny app for data injection. Figure 7.5: Visualization app. After selecting a database, clicking Connect displays the soil data both in a tabular format and as a map showing the locations of soil samples (Figure 7.6). Figure 7.6: Visualization app showing soil data from the selected database. Similar to the dashboard, this tool is designed primarily for data verification and correction. In this app, soil data can be exported to other file formats. 7.3 View data on the QGIS Alternatively, the database can be accessible from your computer opening a PostgreSQL connection from QGIS using the following credentials: Host: &quot;localhost&quot; Port: &quot;5442&quot; User name: &quot;glosis&quot; Password: &quot;glosis&quot; To connect from QGIS: Open QGIS Add a PostGIS layer ((Figure 7.7). Figure 7.7: Adding a PostGIS layer in QGIS. In Connections add a New connection and fill in the connection details (Figure 7.8): Name the connection (in this example glosis-docker). Set the Host name to locaohost. Add the Port details (5442) Add the database name to connect to (in this example glosis). Change it to your database name if a different name has been used. In Authentication move to the Basic tab and enter the default User name (glosis) and password (glosis). Click on Test the connection to check if the database is accessible. Click on OK. Finally, in Connections, click on Connect. The system may prompt you again for the default username and password (glosis). Figure 7.8: Connect to an existing database from QGIS. Once the database has been connected, the geographic features of the database will appear under the core dropdown menu. Select plot, click on Add and the connected database will appear in your layers. At this point, the sampling points contain only the information from the Plot Data sheet in the template. To add values for soil properties, the geographic elements of this table must be linked to the property_phys_chem table, which records such values. This can be done with an SQL query in QGIS. Go to DB Manager in the Database main menu. Select PostGIS in the Providers menu in the left panel and double-click on your the database connection. Click on the SQL Window button (the second button on the top left). Paste the following SQL query, click on the Execute button, and then click Load. Ensure that the Load as a new layer option is selected: SELECT p2.plot_id, p2.plot_code, p2.altitude, p2.time_stamp, p2.map_sheet_code, p2.positional_accuracy, p2.&quot;position&quot; AS geom, s2.code AS specimen_code, r.result_phys_chem_id AS gid, p.name, s.site_id, p3.profile_id, e.upper_depth, e.lower_depth, r.specimen_id, o.property_phys_chem_id, o.procedure_phys_chem_id, r.value, o.unit_of_measure_id FROM core.project p LEFT JOIN core.site_project sp ON sp.project_id = p.project_id LEFT JOIN core.site s ON s.site_id = sp.site_id LEFT JOIN core.plot p2 ON p2.site_id = s.site_id LEFT JOIN core.profile p3 ON p3.plot_id = p2.plot_id LEFT JOIN core.&quot;element&quot; e ON e.profile_id = p3.profile_id LEFT JOIN core.specimen s2 ON s2.element_id = e.element_id LEFT JOIN core.result_phys_chem r ON r.specimen_id = s2.specimen_id LEFT JOIN core.observation_phys_chem o ON o.observation_phys_chem_id = r.observation_phys_chem_id ORDER BY p2.plot_id, p.name, s.site_id, p3.profile_id, e.upper_depth, o.property_phys_chem_id; You will see the resulting layer with the soil attribute table (Figure 7.9) in your QGIS view. Additional attributes can be added to the table using specific SQL queries. Figure 7.9: QGIS Table with soil data.
